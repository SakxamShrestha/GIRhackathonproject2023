# GIRhackathonproject2023
UniSync is a sample web application designed to help students academically. This project was created by Team 'THE BOYZ'. The members were:
1) Sakxam Shrestha
2) Himesh Shrestha
3) Foluso Onatemowo
4) Gabriel Anokye

This web application was submitted as the MVP for our idea. The key features of this application are:
search engine to search notes and research papers related to your major.
discussion forums to present your problems to your university community.
Peer mentoring features connecting juniors with like-minded and enthusiastic seniors.

This is just a beta version of our web application. We sure will be working on this and adding more features, like health and finance, to it.
